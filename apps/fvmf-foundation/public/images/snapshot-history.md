      uid=19_32 StaticText "The Fox Valley Music Foundation and The Venue in Aurora, IL, have played pivotal roles in celebrating, preserving, and promoting music and the arts within the community. Here is a detailed history of both."
      uid=19_33 heading "Introduction" level="5"
      uid=19_34 StaticText "In 1937 and 1938, more than 320 recordings were made in the Sky Club of the Leland Hotel in downtown Aurora for Victor's Bluebird record label. The sessions were "produced" by Lester Melrose. The cream of the crop in terms of Chicago and St. Louis Blues artists took part in the sessions that occurred over a period of 20 months."
      uid=19_35 StaticText "​"
      uid=19_36 StaticText "The (re)discovery of those recordings by a group of Aurora-based blues music lovers led to the creation of the Fox Valley Blues Society and the Blues On The Fox festival. That festival brought together a group of music lovers who, for many years, worked together organizing and running the festival itself with the support of the City of Aurora’s Special Events Division."
      uid=19_37 StaticText "From 2004 until 2009, the Blues On The Fox Festival was managed by The City of Aurora and a group of volunteers, steeped in their love of the Blues. In 2010, the reins for that festival were handed over to the Aurora Civic Center Authority with the Paramount Theatre leading the charge. The volunteer group remained involved with artist selection and the festival in general. Meanwhile, a new performance venue was on the drawing board."
      uid=19_38 StaticText "RiverEdge Park, once a seemingly distant dream, became a reality while the BOTF festival was fast becoming the premier Blues festival in the Midwest. After BOTF outgrew the confines of Galena Boulevard in downtown Aurora, they kicked off the inaugural year for RiverEdge Park in June 2013 with Dr. John and Buddy Guy headlining the weekend event."
      uid=19_39 StaticText "As all of this was taking place, the original volunteer group who nurtured the festival during its formative years reinvented their organization and in 2014, became a 501(c)(3) foundation: the Fox Valley Music Foundation (FVMF). The Foundation's purpose is to Preserve, Protect, Promote, Present, and Educate on music of all genres and its importance in our community."
      uid=19_40 heading "Fox Valley Music Foundation" level="5"
      uid=19_41 StaticText "Since its establishment in 2014, the Fox Valley Music Foundation (FVMF) has served as a champion for music and musicians across the Fox Valley region in Illinois. As a nonprofit organization, its mission has been to celebrate and preserve the rich musical heritage of the area while providing support and opportunities for emerging and established artists."
      uid=19_42 StaticText "​"
      uid=19_43 StaticText "The foundation has tirelessly worked to organize and host diverse musical events, including concerts, workshops, and educational programs, aiming to engage and inspire audiences of all ages and backgrounds.

      uid=19_46 heading "The Venue" level="5"
      uid=19_47 StaticText "The Fox Valley Music Foundation is the home of The Venue, the 200-seat listening room housed in the old Woolworth Building in the heart of downtown Aurora. Since its opening in June 2019, The Venue has emerged as a premier destination for live entertainment and artistic expression, and has encapsulated the spirit of creativity and innovation, providing a stage for a diverse range of performances and musical experiences."
      uid=19_48 StaticText "​"
