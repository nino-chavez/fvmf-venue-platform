      uid=23_28 StaticText "Art Sheridan was born in Chicago in 1925 and founded Chance Records in 1950. Chance specialized in Blues, Jazz, Doo-Wop and Gospel. Shortly after forming Chance, Art became a behind the scenes partner in Vee-Jay Records and went on to own several jazz clubs on the near north side. The Flamingos, The Moonglows, Homesick James and J.B. Hutto recorded for Chance, and while a part of Vee-Jay, he enjoyed success with Gene Chandler, The Four Seasons, and The Beatles, just to name a few."

In celebration of his recent 90th birthday, he engaged in an annual skydive in Ottawa, IL, which is at the foot of the Fox River Valley area. Sheridan recently sat down with the Foundation and talked about his life in music and let us in on some more private parts of his life that will forever remain within the confines of our memories and the walls of the ACTV studio where the interview took place."
      uid=23_32 StaticText "The program is brought to you, and made possible in part, by the Kane County Board, through its Office of Community Reinvestment, with funds provided by the Grand Victoria Riverboat Casino. The funds awarded to the Fox Valley Music Foundation from the Grand Victoria Riverboat Fund were used to purchase video cameras with which to film interviews as conducted and editing equipment used to produce the resulting footage."
