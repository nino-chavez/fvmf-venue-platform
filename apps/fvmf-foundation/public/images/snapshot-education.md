Shortly after forming Chance, Art became a behind the scenes partner in Vee-Jay Records and went on to own several jazz clubs on the near north side. The Flamingos, The Moonglows, Homesick James and J.B. Hutto recorded for Chance, and while a part of Vee-Jay, he enjoyed success with Gene Chandler, The Four Seasons, and The Beatles, just to name a few."

Unknown to the participants at the time, the sessions would later be considered historic, and would take part in the development of future recording techniques, the development of post-war Chicago Blues, and the birth of Rock and Roll."

The very first recordings of John Lee "Sonny Boy" Williamson took place on May 5, 1937. His iconic and Blues Hall of Fame song, "Good Morning, (Little) Schoolgirl" was recorded in downtown Aurora on that day. He was 23 years old."
