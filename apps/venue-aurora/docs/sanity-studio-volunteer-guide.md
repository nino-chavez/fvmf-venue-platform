## Blog Post Best Practices

### Content Guidelines

**Length:**
- Aim for 500-1,500 words
- Artist spotlights: 800-1,200 words
- Event recaps: 400-800 words
- Guides/tutorials: 1,000-1,500 words

**Tone & Voice:**
- Conversational but professional
- Passionate about music
- Welcoming to newcomers
- Authentic and genuine (no corporate jargon)

**Structure:**
1. **Opening Hook** - Start with an interesting fact, question, or story
2. **Context** - Provide background information
3. **Main Content** - Deliver on the promise of your headline
4. **Conclusion** - End with a call-to-action or forward-looking statement

**Call-to-Action Examples:**
- "Get tickets to [Artist Name]'s next show →"
- "Sign up for our newsletter to hear about upcoming events"
- "Follow us on Instagram @VenueAurora for more behind-the-scenes content"

### Image Guidelines

**Do:**
- Use high-resolution photos (minimum 1200px wide)
- Get permission for artist photos
- Credit photographers in captions when applicable
- Use venue photos from official gallery
- Compress large files before uploading

**Don't:**
- Use blurry or low-quality images
- Post photos without permission
- Forget alt text (hurts accessibility and SEO)

### Writing Headlines

**Good Headlines:**
- "5 Things You Didn't Know About Blues Legend Willie Buck"
- "Behind the Scenes: Preparing The Venue for Sold-Out Shows"
- "Meet the Volunteers Who Make The Venue Aurora Special"

**Weak Headlines:**
- "Concert Review" (too vague)
- "New Blog Post" (not descriptive)
- "Check This Out" (no information)

**Tips:**
- Use numbers when relevant ("5 Tips...", "3 Reasons...")
- Include the artist or event name
- Promise value ("How to...", "Guide to...", "Behind the Scenes...")
- Keep under 60 characters when possible
